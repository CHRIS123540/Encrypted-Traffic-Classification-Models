# Encrypted-Traffic-Classification-Models

We reproduce the source code of several encrypted traffic classification models via Pytorch DL framework proposed in some papers.
* MATEC: A lightweight neural network for online encrypted traffic classification [Computer Networks'21]
* TSCRNN: A novel classification scheme of encrypted traffic based on flow spatiotemporal features for efficient management of IIoT [Computer Networks'21]
* Self-attentive deep learning method for online traffic classification and its interpretability [Computer Networks'21]
* Deep Packet: A Novel Approach For Encrypted Traffic Classification Using Deep Learning  
* Identification of Encrypted Traffic Through Attention Mechanism Based Long Short Term Memory [IEEE Transactions on Big Data'19]
* Datanet: Deep Learning Based Encrypted Network Traffic Classification in SDN Home Gateway [IEEE Access'18]
